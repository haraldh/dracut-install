/*
A Represents the addend used to compute the value of the relocatable field.

B Represents the base address at which a shared object has been loaded into memory
during execution. Generally, a shared object is built with a 0 base virtual
address, but the execution address will be different.

G Represents the offset into the global offset table at which the relocation entry’s
symbol will reside during execution.

GOT Represents the address of the global offset table.

L Represents the place (section offset or address) of the Procedure Linkage Table
entry for a symbol.

P Represents the place (section offset or address) of the storage unit being relocated
-> that is the relocations offset in loaded memory, so for example a relocation at offset 0x3 in
.text which is loaded at 0x100 will have P = 0x103

S Represents the value of the symbol whose index resides in the relocation entry.
The AMD64 ABI architectures uses only Elf64_Rela relocation entries
with explicit addends. The r_addend member serves as the relocation addend.
